# Fraud Detection Analysis

## Project Overview
Advanced fraud detection system analyzing 2.36 billion financial transactions using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent patterns and optimize operational efficiency.

## Key Results
* **99.11% fraud detection accuracy** on 2.36 billion transactions
* **172x better than random detection**
* **Critical discovery**: 5x fraud spike during 22-23 PM hours
* **Operational efficiency**: Only 0.14% transactions need manual review
* **Manual review reduction**: 99.86% workload decrease

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset Preparation

Extract the compressed dataset files:

fraudTest.7z → fraudTest.csv
fraudTrain.7z → fraudTrain.csv


Ensure both CSV files are in the root directory
Run the analysis:

bashpython fraud_detection_analysis.py
Data Visualizations
Interactive Tableau dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gehan.weerasinghe/viz/FraudDetectionAnalysis_17522500038950/Dashboard1
Dashboard includes:
