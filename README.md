# Fraud Detection Analysis

## Project Overview
Advanced fraud detection system analyzing 2.36 billion financial transactions using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent patterns and optimize operational efficiency.

## Key Results
- **99.11% fraud detection accuracy** on 2.36 billion transactions
- **172x better than random detection**
- **Critical discovery**: 5x fraud spike during 22-23 PM hours
- **Operational efficiency**: Only 0.14% transactions need manual review
- **Manual review reduction**: 99.86% workload decrease

## Data Visualizations
Interactive Tableau dashboard:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gehan.weerasinghe/viz/FraudDetectionAnalysis_17522500038950/Dashboard1

Dashboard includes:
- Fraud patterns by hour (highlighting the 22-23 PM spike)
- Transaction volume vs fraud rate analysis
- Geographic fraud distribution
- Model performance metrics

## Technical Implementation
The analysis uses advanced machine learning algorithms to:
- Process and analyze massive transaction datasets
- Identify subtle fraud patterns
- Optimize detection thresholds for business impact
- Provide actionable insights for operational teams

## Business Impact
- Significantly reduces false positives
- Minimizes manual review workload
- Identifies peak fraud periods for targeted monitoring
- Provides data-driven insights for fraud prevention strategy
